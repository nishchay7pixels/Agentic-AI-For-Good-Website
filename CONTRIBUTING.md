problem_solved: |
  Explain why this tool exists and what it replaces or eliminates.
  What was painful before? What can developers stop doing manually?
  The more specific, the better the search quality.

# At least 3 use cases. More is better — all of them improve search.

## What makes a good submission?

**Required:**
- `problem_solved` — this is the most important field. Be specific about the before/after. Vague descriptions make for poor search results.
- At least 3 `use_cases` — concrete examples, not feature names.

**Not accepted:**
- Tools without a public URL or repository
- Duplicate tools already in the catalog
- Commercial tools with no free tier (unless truly exceptional)

---

## After you open a PR

- CI validates your YAML automatically (usually takes < 30s)
- A maintainer reviews and merges
- On merge, embeddings are generated and the tool appears on the site within minutes
